However, one thing I crave more of is a space to publish content that's not curated to appease requirements set about from a third-party. In this case, exercising my creative writing in longer-form content. Yes, social media posts allow you to write lengthy captions, and the 'stories' format is a good way of (re)posting content with audience engagement. But, for me personally, the freedom of being able to write, without having to concern myself with the surrounding algorithm-trends is a refreshing change (both in terms of consuming and creating) to the competitive influencer-saturated space of social media.
