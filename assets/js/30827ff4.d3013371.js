The island is packed with a vibrant culture, lush jungles filled with wildlife, sandy beaches, great food, ancient temples, and hospitable and friendly people. From the busy streets to the calm and isolated back-roads, there is so much to explore. \\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n<Sep/>\\n\\n## General\\n\\n**Climate**: Sri Lanka is located approximately 350 - 645 km north of the equator placing it firmly in the tropics, with coastlines experiencing around 25\xb0-35\xb0C and inline highlands somewhat cooler at 15\xb0-18\xb0C. \\n\\nDue to the countries size and location, different areas of the country experience monsoons at different times throughout the year. So if you\'re wanting something specific on your trip, make sure to plan accordingly. \\n\\n**November** \u2192 **March** is typically monsoon season in the north and north east \u26c8, and dry weather in the south and south west coast \u2600\ufe0f. **April** \u2192 **September** is then the reverse. \\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>\\n\u2b07\ufe0f Check out the weather in an interactive map.\\n</summary>\\n\\n <iframe src=\\"https://www.ventusky.com/?p=8.0;81.3;5&l=rain-3h\\" title=\\"W3Schools Free Online Web Tutorials\\" width=\\"700px\\" height=\\"500px\\"></iframe> \\n\\n</details>\\n\\n**Hygiene**:\\n\\n- Tap water is not drinkable. Drink only bottled water. Also check if the cap on the bottle you receive is sealed, and not already broken. If you expect a drink to come with ice, clarify what water the ice is made with. \\n- Check your local countries vaccine recommendations when traveling. Sri Lanka has many mosquitos, particularly in the humid regions inland and around areas with sitting water such as rice fields. \\n- Sun cream and (tropical) mosquito spray is a must.\\n- There are many wild dogs in Sri Lanka on the streets. As much as we love a good doggo, don\'t approach them.\\n\\n\\n**Language**: Sri Lanka has two main languages; Sinhala and Tamil. Sinhala, (spoken by Sinhalese people) is most prevalent in the central, west, and south of Sri Lanka. Tamil, (spoken by Tamils) is dominant in the north and east. Throughout Sri Lanka all road signs, busses, tourist information, and other infrastructure organizations will features both languages. The main foreign language is English. Although, do not expect that every local will speak english, most do not.  \\n\\n<Sep/>\\n\\n\\n## The South West Route\\n\\nUnless you\'ve got a specific location in mind, the season your traveling will likely influence your route in Sri Lanka. Our trip was one of the more popular travel routes for shorter periods that goes around the mountain range in the central south.  \\n\\n  <FullWidthImage \\n    imagePath={route}\\n    description={{\\n        title: \\"Travel Route\\",\\n        content: (<p> 1.

South west coast</p>),\\n    }}\\n  FullWidthImage/>\\n\\n<Sep/>\\n\\n## Gear Check\\n\\n**Backpack**: If you\'re traveling around from place to place, even at ease with taxi\'s or trains, I would wholly recommend taking a backpack instead of a suitcase. Even in busses, they will utilize every space (and I mean every space), so if you\'ve got a bulky suitcase that needs to be wheeled or carried, you\'re going to find it hard to find a suitable spot.\\n\\nChances are, you will also (at some point) have to take some back-road that a car simply can not accommodate. In this case, you\'ll be taking a tuk tuk, or even walking. You really do not want to be caught out rolling a suitcase through some dirt tracks making an ungodly amount of noise whilst simultaneously ruining the wheels of your suitcase. \\n\\nIf you\'re carrying expensive camera gear, then the vibrations of the uneven surfaces will likely not do much good. \\nA backpack is simply easier to transport is these conditions, and gives you much more opportunity to organize your equipment, and be more \\n\\n**Drone Regulations**: To bring your drone through customs and have permission to fly the drone in the country, your drone has to be registered through the Sri Lanka Aviation Authorities. Luckily, this process is simple and transparent on their website. For me it was a 1-day turnaround from submission to approval for a DJI Mini Pro 4. \\n\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n    <summary>\\n    \u2b07\ufe0f Step-by-step drone application \\n    </summary>\\n    1) Visit the caa.lk website and start the application  \ud83c\udf10 https://portal.caa.lk/drone/apply-now/report.php \\n</details>\\n\\n**Clothing**: Sri Lanka\'s tropical climate means bringing clothes for hot and humid weather. Anything breathable is perfect. Have one good **fleece** for evenings and mornings for the inland weather, where temperatures are somewhat cooler. I\'d recommend a **raincoat** even if you\'re traveling in the dry season. Torrential downpours of rain can occur within a minute, and last as quickly as 5 minutes.    \\n\\n<Sep/> \\n\\n\\n{/* <ImageFeatureTripple\\n    imagePath1={_Spices}\\n    imagePath2={_Bananas}\\n    imagePath3={_KingCoconuts}\\n    description={{\\n        title: \\"King Coconuts\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            A description \\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n}}\\n/> */}\\n\\n## Means of Travel \\n\\n### Tuk Tuk\\n\\n The most convenient way to get around in Sri Lanka is, by far, using a Tuk Tuk. If you\'re not familiar, Tuk Tuk\'s (Sinhalese for the general *auto rickshaw*) are small three-wheelers that are available to rent or hire as a taxi service. The engines are mostly 4-stroke (older models were previously 2-stroke), and have one front seat for the driver, and space enough for two adults in the rear passenger seat. Most will also have a small space behind the passenger seat to place goods or bags. \\n \\n These things can, and often do, go through almost every type of terrain and weather day after day. If you\'re backpacking around Sri Lanka, Tuk Tuk\'s will most likely be your lifeline getting to small remote places that you will want to see, or even longer distances.\\n\\n  <FullWidthImage \\n    imagePath={_TukTuk}\\n    description={{\\n        title: \\"Tuk Tuk\\",\\n        content: (<p> A round trip day trip with a private Tuk Tuk driver [taken on the way to Ambuluwawa tower]. </p>),\\n    }}\\n  FullWidthImage/>\\n\\n\\n **How to get one**: Getting a Tuk Tuk is probably the easiest thing you can do. As a foreign traveler you are (for better or worse) a walking advertisement of cash. Simply walk along the street, there\'s a high chance a local will ask if you want to rent their Tuk Tuk. \\n\\n **Cost**: Sri Lankan\'s are a helpful and positive people. However, there are always bad actors looking to take advantage of an opportune moment. Here are some things to watch out for... \\n \\n \\n - If you\'re recognized as a foreigner, it\'s very likely some Tuk Tuk drivers will attempt to overcharge you (relative to the cost of what they\'d charge a local). Understand that while this seems unfair, locals see you as someone who is coming from a more economically stable (and profitable) country who can afford higher prices. Do your research beforehand on how much a journey will cost to see if (and by how much) they might be overcharging you. Ask you hostel / hotel on what the rate should be for the distance. I\'d generally not recommend trying to haggle over 300 LKR around the going rate, this basically amounts to 1 EUR.\\n\\n - Drivers will sometimes ask if it\'s your first time in Sri Lanka, and also how long you have been there. While this is sometimes as honest as open conversation, it\'s also good social engineering and a means to understand your level of local knowledge. If you say its your first time, some drivers might ask if you\'d like to drive the Tuk Tuk to get some fun experience. This is indeed fun, but it\'s also a tactic for them to build trust. The driver will likely then say they can drive you everywhere you\'d like to go for a *great* price. Sharing such an experience is a good mean for them to overcharging you, without you questioning it. This indeed happened to us, and we subsequently found out the driver grossly overcharged us.  \\n\\n :::tip Travel Tip\\n\\n If you want to test what a price might be, you can download the PickMe Sri Lanka App. This is basically an \xfcber service for Sri Lanka. However, many locals refuse to accept journeys because PickMe takes 20\\\\% commission for smaller vehicles (i.e., Tuk Tuk\'s). So, while a Tuk Tuk is normally the cheapest option, the driver will earn even less due to the companies commission. The commission rate reduced with larger vehicles that can take more passengers. \\n\\n Nevertheless, the App is still good for looking at a \'\'standard\'\' rate. You can then use that a point of negotiation.  \\n\\n ::: \\n\\n\\n### Car\\n\\nFor longer journeys or if you\'re a larger group, traveling by car might be the best option - for price and speed. If you\'ve not got long to travel (e.g., < 2 weeks), you won\'t have the luxury of spending a whole day for low-cost public services to travel from place to place. If you\'re doing this multiple times, this can quickly eat into actual sightseeing goals. \\n\\nCompared to Tuk Tuk\'s, the cost of a car taxi service is not so competitive. This is because chances are, you\'re traveling longer distances and they will get a reasonable amount of money regardless, and the higher cost will be cheaper in the long run for more people.\\n\\nThe PickMe app can be used to find local taxis, or better, ask your hostel or hotel for local services. These are likely friends or family.\\n\\n### Bus\\n\\nBusses in Sri Lanka are on another level. These machines are king of the road, and make zero compromises on speed, road space, decorations, and number of passengers. My recommendation is, if you can, make all long distance journeys using the bus, or even for shorter trips if you\'re going along a main road.\\n\\n\\n    \\n### Train\\n\\n  <FullWidthImage \\n        imagePath={_TrainStation} \\n        description={{\\n        title: \\"Ella Train Station \\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            Waiting for the train for the famous Kandy \u2192 Ella train ride.  \\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\nFullWidthImage/>\\n\\n<Sep/>\\n\\n## Locations\\n\\n\\n\\n### Dambulla\\n\\n#### Travel\\n\\nTraveling to Dambulla From Colombo, we initially took a Tuk Tuk from our accommodation to Negombo, where we then got the bus to Dambulla. \\n\\nThe bus connection was **No. 34** Dambulla Station \u2192 Kurunegala Station, and the change to **No. 48** Kurunegala Station \u2192 Dambulla Station. Then from Dambulla bus station we took a Tuk Tuk to our accommodation.\\n\\n#### Accommodation\\n\\nOur accommodation in Dambulla was a homestay roughly 21 km south of the main city. We wanted somewhere with a bit more of a rural feel to see some of the locals, as there is no shortage of busy city streets. \\n\\nThe Blue Mountains View homestay, located in \\"The Village\\" (referred to by the locals) is part of a farm that grows a variety of fruit and vegetables for the local community. The host, Pradeep, runs the tourist side of the business together with his father who run the majority of the farming. His mother is the heart of the gastronomy, where you\'ll get to experience some locally cooked food home grown from the farm. \\n\\nOn the morning of after our first night Pradeep gave us a tour of the farm showing all the local goods that are grown, including a very large banana farm, tomato\'s, coconuts, spices, etc. The tour really was a highlight of this trip, and the rooms, and facilities were also nicely kept. If you wanted to eat at the homestay, various group seatings are available in the main kitchen or near your rooms. These spots are great for soaking in the atmosphere, and wildlife around the farm. \\n\\n#### Activities\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Photography Highlights\\n\\n<ImageFeatureDouble\\n    imagePath1={_LionsRock}\\n    imagePath2={_Monkey}\\n    description1={{\\n        title: \\"Lion\'s Rock\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            The view from climbing Pidurangala Rock.\\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\n    description2={{\\n        title: \\"Monkey See\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            On the way to the Cave Temple.\\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\n\\n### Kandy\\n\\n#### Arrival\\n\\n{/* <ImageFeatureSingleLeft\\n    imagePath={_05}\\n    description={{\\n        title: \\"Tower\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            A description \\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n}}\\n/> */}\\n\\n### Ella \\n\\n#### Arrival\\n\\n<ImageFeatureDouble\\n    imagePath1={_EllaBridge}\\n    imagePath2={_AdamsPeak}\\n    description1={{\\n        title: \\"Nine Arches Bridge\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            The famous Bridge in Ella completed in 1919.\\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\n    description2={{\\n        title: \\"Little Adams Peak\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            Summit of the Little Adam\'s Peak trail (1,141 m)\\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\n**Accommodation:**\\n\\n### Udawalawae\\n\\n<ImageFeatureDouble\\n    imagePath1={_ElephantLong}\\n    imagePath2={_04}\\n    description1={{\\n        title: \\"Hard to Miss\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            One of the many elephants in the national park. \\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\n    description2={{\\n        title: \\"Easy to Miss\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            The smaller camouflage variety.\\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\n**Accommodation:**\\n\\n### South Coast\\n\\n<ImageFeatureDouble\\n    imagePath1={_08}\\n    imagePath2={_Sunset}\\n    description1={{\\n        title: \\"Ocean Fishing\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            One of the many elephants in the national park. \\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\n    description2={{\\n        title: \\"Easy to Miss\\",\\n        content: (\\n        <p>\\n            The smaller camouflage variety.\\n        </p>\\n        ),\\n    }}\\n/>\\n\\n**Accommodation:**"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/tomstimecapsule/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-01-01-welcome/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-01-welcome/index.mdx","title":"A Different Kind of Content","description":"Hi everyone \u2014 I\'m Tom, a 33 year old photographer.

Some eight years and change later I\'m still here. Welcome to the first journal entry... */}\\n\\n## What\'s This About?\\n\\nOne of the things I love about photography is how it\'s broadened my perspectives, behaviors, and appreciation of what life has to offer. Weather enjoying the moment, exploring an environment, working for a client, or simply traveling to work, being a photographer means life has a new composition. Even walking down a street i\'v walked down many times before, I still catch find myself challenging my creative eye as to what would make a good composition.\\n\\nPhotography involves numerous creative and technical elements such as composition, camera optics, light, storytelling, editing, and even social skills, to name but a few. As most of my educational and professional life has involved combining creative and technical aspects, photography offers a second outlet that utilizes many of the skills I have learned throughout my career, with the notable (yet pleasant) absence of code compilation errors or statistical analysis. Moreover, the immediate feedback of a captured image offers a nice contrast to the more arduous and lengthy process of research. However, there is one element that I miss in photography that, in and of itself, falls short of when it comes to creativity \u2014 writing.\\n\\nI hear you \u2014 \\"Tom, photography is about storytelling through imagery, not reading an essay\\", and I completely agree, a picture tells a 1000 words, as the saying goes.\\n\\n<Sep/>\\n\\n## So what\'s the goal here?\\n\\nThe goal with this journal is to add different a kind of photography-related content... different than what normal social media outlets are designed for, anyway.\\n\\nSocial media is a great way to post a 1000-word picture, and there are many pro\'s to using such platforms. Low-maintenance, networking, a ready-to-go publication channel to a potentially unlimited audience, and so on. However, one thing I crave more of is a space to publish content that\'s not curated to appease requirements set about from a third-party. In this case, exercising my creative writing in longer-form content. Yes, social media posts allow you to write lengthy captions, and the \'stories\' format is a good way of (re)posting content with audience engagement. But, for me personally, the freedom of being able to write, without having to concern myself with the surrounding algorithm-trends is a refreshing change (both in terms of consuming and creating) to the competitive influencer-saturated space of social media. I understand the irony of still having to use social media to promote / advertise this new space. However, the creative writing, content, format, and presentation are only limited by own knowledge.\\n\\nRegardless of social media, I simply enjoy writing, and enjoy being able to refine my thoughts down on a page. Photography, for me, is a tool that not only captures an image, but also captures your thoughts, ideas, and intentions at that specific moment. Hence, I believe there\'s a lot more that can be shared about the experience that goes beyond the image. For many people the surrounding overhead of designing and developing an online space is work that can be simply bypassed with other online services, website designers, assets repositories etc. However, this is also something I find interesting, and to combine it with photography and writing feels like a win-win.\\n\\n<Sep/>\\n\\n## What You Can Expect?\\n\\nFor now, this website will consist of the following:\\n\\n- A sample portfolio of photography for public and clients.\\n- Creative writing in the form of journal entries for the following topics:\\n    - Thoughts: A place to collect and share ideas around the various aspects of photography including; editing, social media, and aspects around quality and human psychology.\\n    - Places: Entries around places I\'ve visited, backpacking, and general travel and adventure.\\n    - Gear: Sharing experiences with photography gear.\\n\\nThe future holds many possibilities, and I hope to build on this space with collaborative entries, invite other co-authors to publish their own opinions and experiences, and include some larger projects including videography. However, for now, this is simply the first step. \\n\\nThanks for reading, and see you in the next one."}]}}')}}]);
